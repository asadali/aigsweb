Design
Static page vs CMS
Google sites should provide good templates for handing this part. Lets get the username and password from Viraj and see what options we got?
respondcms? Twitter Bootstrap with CMS backend - best of both worlds

Execution
Domain Name / Google Sites
Domain name : Should ideally be aigs.ucsd.edu. For instance, ISA has http://isa.ucsd.edu/ - need someone to get this done?
Narendran : to check with Skanda and mail CSEHelp to ask about aigs.ucsd.edu webspace and domain name availability.
Currently a Google/Bing search for “aigs ucsd” returns the google site as the first result. So Google site should be good enough for now? Maybe setup a DNS redirect once we can obtain it from college?
